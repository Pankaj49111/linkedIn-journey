Data integrity was shattered.\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t happen. The key ensures ordering per user.\n\nBut the processing queue was showing deposits arriving after corresponding withdrawals, consistently. The contradiction was jarring.\n\nMy personal assumption was that the service guarantee inherently extended through the entire asynchronous pipeline. I was wrong.\n\nThen I saw the consumer group logs: a partition rebalance initiated by a slow consumer. The re-read offset broke the strict sequence.\n\nKafka guarantees order within the partition, but group offsets can shift processing windows. We relied too heavily on infrastructure guarantees when the application needed atomic sequence checks.\n\nThe Moral \ud83d\udc47\nTrust the wire, but validate the sequence stamp.",
