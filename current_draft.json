  "post_text": "I built the fastest permissions service ever. We all paid.\nI believed heavily in separation of concerns. The AuthZ Service was designed to decouple complex security logic from our application features.\n\nOur goal was a centralized, performant source of truth. I focused intensely on P99 latency, pruning the API contract down to only essential fields. This rigid definition seemed like robust defensive programming.\n\nSix months later, a major marketing initiative spiked traffic 4x overnight. We immediately needed to integrate a new, time-sensitive permission attribute.\n\nChanging the service required five downstream teams to update their clients immediately. Their disparate deployment timelines created unavoidable dependency drift. We saw cascading failures and stale data due to cache invalidation logic mismatching across the ecosystem.\n\nThe contract became a shared liability we couldn't unilaterally service.\n\nWhat this taught me \ud83d\udc47\nWe had optimized solely for speed of access, forgetting the critical need for independent speed of change \ud83e\udde9.\n\n#backend #engineering #software #java",
